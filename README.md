1.Diabetic-Retinopathy

Diabetic retinopathy (die-uh-BET-ik ret-ih-NOP-uh-thee) is a diabetes complication that affects eyes. It's caused by damage to the blood vessels of the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye (retina).
At first, diabetic retinopathy might cause no symptoms or only mild vision problems. But it can lead to blindness.
The condition can develop in anyone who has type 1 or type 2 diabetes. The longer you have diabetes and the less controlled your blood sugar is, the more likely you are to develop this eye complication.

This project maily focuses on identifying the case and classify if the patient has the disease or not.
We use OpenCV technique to classify the images accordingly. 

2.Diabetic Identification
The folder contains a separate file that includes code specifically developed to evaluate a patient's likelihood of having diabetes based on a range of numerical health indicators. This code processes and analyzes key medical metrics such as:

Pregnancies: The number of times the patient has been pregnant.
Glucose: Blood glucose concentration levels.
Blood Pressure: Diastolic blood pressure measurement.
Skin Thickness: Triceps skinfold thickness, which serves as an indicator of body fat.
Insulin: Serum insulin levels.
BMI (Body Mass Index): A measure of body fat based on height and weight.
Diabetes Pedigree Function: A function that scores the likelihood of diabetes based on family history.
Age: The patientâ€™s age.
Outcome: The result indicating whether the patient is diabetic or not.
The code uses these parameters to generate an outcome that determines the presence or absence of diabetes in the patient.
